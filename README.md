# Optimisation-2-Project
Group project for TMA4183 Optimization II at NTNU spring 2021.

This is the code for the numerical optimization part of the group work in the project for TMA4183 Optimization II at NTNU the spring of 2021. 
We developed a projected gradient descent method to minimize an integral cost functional with heat equation constraints and boundary controls.
Code running the optimization is contained in `main.py`, importing code from all the auxilliary files and saving results to disk.
The project uses the `FEniCS` computing platform throughout for computing the finite element method variational problems in each time step.
